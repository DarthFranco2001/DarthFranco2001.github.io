        Detecting cancer sounds like a weird and difficult task, right? And it certainly is. But what if I told you
        that it might be possible using gold particles smaller than a speck of dust and laser beams like the ones
        in Star Wars? It may sound like science fiction, but it’s a real possibility thanks to the combination of
        nanotechnology and physics.
      </p>
      <p>
        How can something so tiny and invisible to the naked eye help us fight one of the world’s deadliest diseases?
        To convince you, I’ll walk you through the process step by step— and the best part? No math required!
      </p>
      <p>
        Gold plays a key role in this process. While detecting cancer cells can be challenging, gold is much easier
        to detect—thanks to its properties as a metal (though we’ll dive into this a bit more later). Cancer cells are
        extremely small, so the first step is to break down the gold into a size so tiny that it’s measured in
        billionths of a meter. These minuscule gold particles are what we call gold nanoparticles[1].
      </p>
      <img src="images/ShapesNanoGold.png" alt="Gold nanoparticles shapes">
      <p class="caption">
        There are countless ways to synthesize gold nanoparticles, and they have many applications beyond
        cancer detection.[1], [2].
      </p>

      <p>
        Once we’ve broken the gold down into tiny nanoparticles, the next step is to get them to stick to the cancer
        cells somehow. To do this, some brilliant scientists came up with the wonderful idea of creating a coating
        for the nanoparticles, which contains antibodies that make the coating stick to the cancer cells[3].
      </p>
      <img src="images/AdherinCancer.png" alt="Nanoparticles targeting cancer">
      <p class="caption">Illustration of the previous paragraph</p>
    </div>

    <div class="biomedical-box">
      <p>
        After the nanoparticles have successfully attached to the cancer cells, how do we detect them? This is where
        lasers and a bit of physics come into play. To understand how we detect gold nanoparticles, imagine directing
        a laser at a piece of gold and a cancer cell. When the laser strikes both the gold and the cancer cell, they
        heat up as they absorb some of the laser’s energy. This heating causes vibrations around them, and it’s these
        vibrations that we can measure using a widely known technique called ultrasound [4]—the same method used to
        monitor babies during pregnancy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The interesting part is that gold and cancer cells are different materials, meaning they have distinct
        properties. Specifically, gold, being a metal, is a better conductor of heat than cancer cells. This causes it
        to absorb more energy from the laser and generate stronger vibrations than the cancer cells, allowing us
        to observe these intense vibrations through ultrasound.
      </p>
      <img src="images/PA.png" alt="Photoacoustic ultrasound detection">
      <p class="caption">
        Fig. 3: Since gold nanoparticles generate stronger vibrations than cancer cells, this will appear as a
        brighter spot in an ultrasound image.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this, I hope I’ve convinced you that we can use gold nanoparticles to detect cancer cells. However, if
        we analyze this in detail, we’re oversimplifying things into an ideal case where only gold nanoparticles and
        cancer cells exist. The reality is that in real tissue, other components like skin, blood, water, fats, and
        many others are also involved[5]. Moreover, there are lasers of many colors—red, blue, green—and some
        emit light that our eyes can’t see, like ultraviolet and infrared. Could the color of the laser affect anything?
        The answer is yes[4], and this is where physics and math start to get complicated, but also quite interesting.
        But why am I telling you all this complicated stuff? Well, this is where my love for mathematics comes into play.

        The most efficient way to detect gold nanoparticles remains an open research question, as there is no single
        solution. In fact, different mathematical algorithms can be employed, each with its own set of advantages and
        disadvantages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Knowing I’m a math enthusiast, on June 7, 2023, my supervisor, Dr. Diego Dumani, an expert in bioengineering,
        challenged me to use my knowledge to develop a new method/algorithm for detecting these gold nanoparticles.
      </p>
      <p>
        The challenge was a long process filled with setbacks. However, I have now developed a solution that appears
        to be viable—or at least, that is what the computer simulations suggest.
      </p>
      <img src="images/Equation.png" alt="Math equation of algorithm">
      <p class="caption">
        This collection of strange symbols is the summary of more than a year and a half of research aimed at optimizing
        metastasis detection using lasers and gold nanoparticles.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, why create a new algorithm if scientists have already worked on this problem? In the studies I’ve reviewed,
        the most common methods can be grouped as “solutions to linear regression models with numerical analysis”[4], [6].
        But since that name is quite complicated, we will refer to them as “typical methods.”
      </p>
      <p>
        My new algorithm aims to make everything faster and cheaper compared to the “typical methods,” even if it
        sacrifices a small amount of accuracy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="biomedical-box">
      <img src="images/comparison.png" alt="Comparison of detection methods">
      <p class="caption">
        The image on the left shows nanoparticle detection using the “typical methods,” while the image on the right
        shows nanoparticle detection using the method proposed by me.
      </p>

      <p>
        As mentioned earlier, my method/algorithm reduces costs because the “typical methods” require lasers of multiple
        colors (at least four), whereas my method only needs two. Additionally, it saves time since the “typical methods”
        require a study of the individual’s vein arrangement, which varies from person to person. In contrast, my method
        eliminates the need for this step.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, these time and cost benefits have to come at a price, right? Well, if you take a close look at Figure 5,
        you can see that the image from my method looks a bit more blurred. But I don’t know, I’d say they look pretty
        similar, haha.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this, I conclude the best summary I can offer of what I consider my humble contribution to the scientific
        community, without delving too deeply into the technical details. I hope you enjoyed this journey and learned
        something new!
